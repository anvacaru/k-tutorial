It is ambiguous because it is unclear wether the `Right` branch is from the first Tree, or from the second Tree.

After using the `[prefer]` attribute:
    `Left__LESSON-04-EX3_Tree_Tree`(`Left_Right__LESSON-04-EX3_Tree_Tree_Tree`(`Leaf__LESSON-04-EX3_Tree_Exp`(`false_LESSON-04-EX3_Exp`(.KList)),`Leaf__LESSON-04-EX3_Tree_Exp`(`false_LESSON-04-EX3_Exp`(.KList))))
